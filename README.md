# Kraken Trading Bot

A Python-based trading bot designed to scalp **BTC/USD** on Kraken. The bot now supports multiple exchanges using an adapter layer, so you can choose between **Kraken** and **Bitget** via an environment variable. It uses **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** and **MACD** indicators to execute trades, aiming to increase USD holdings. The bot is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and includes detailed logging.

## Features

- **Automated Trading**:
  - Executes buy orders when RSI indicates oversold and MACD signals a bullish crossover.
  - Only adds more buy orders if the new price improves upon the last buy price (configurable threshold).
  - Executes sell orders when RSI indicates overbought and MACD signals a bearish crossover.

- **Technical Indicators**:
  - **RSI**: Identifies overbought/oversold conditions.
  - **MACD**: Measures trend momentum and identifies crossovers.
  - **Bollinger Bands**: Dynamic support/resistance for more accurate signals.

- **Trend & Timeframe Confirmation**:
  - **Trend Filter (Optional)**: Uses a moving average to confirm trend direction.  
    For example:
    - Only take buy signals if current price > MA (indicating an uptrend).
    - Only take sell signals if current price < MA (indicating a downtrend).
  - **Higher Timeframe Confirmation (Optional)**:  
    Confirms signals from the primary chart with a higher timeframe (e.g., 5m) RSI and MACD.  
    This helps reduce false signals by ensuring short-term setups align with broader market trends.

- **Daily Statistics Summary**:
  - At the end of each day (UTC), the bot automatically calculates and sends a Telegram message summarizing:
    - Current account balances
    - Profit/Loss for the last 24 hours
    - Profit/Loss for the last 7 days
    - Profit/Loss for the last 30 days
  - This daily report helps you track performance over multiple timeframes without manual effort.

- **Secure and Flexible**:
  - API credentials stored as environment variables for security.
  - Fully configurable trading parameters (e.g., trade amount, indicator thresholds, trend filters, higher timeframe confirmations).

- **Multi-Exchange Support**:
  - Now supports multiple exchanges using an adapter layer.  
    Choose between **Kraken** and **Bitget** by setting the `EXCHANGE` environment variable.

- **Containerized Deployment**:
  - Easy to deploy with Docker and Docker Compose.

- **Detailed Logging**:
  - Logs buy/sell signals, trend conditions, higher timeframe confirmations, and indicator values.
  - Telegram alerts keep you informed of executed trades and daily performance metrics.
